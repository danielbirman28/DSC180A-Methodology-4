1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found the topic of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to be the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter because it combines  information retrieval with text generation models like GPT to produce more accurate and up-to-date responses.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I’d like to investigate the naunces in sentiment analysis for emotions when analyzing a poltical article to detect misinformation/disinformation.

3. **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In my Quarter 1 Project, I focused heavily on getting all of my models really accurate. For Quarter 2, I’d like to shift the focus toward making these models more realistic and comprehensive rather than for just shooting for the best accuracy possible.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in experimenting with GenAi as we have not reached that portion of the content yet. It'll be interesting to see how that integrates into the already existing predictive machine learning models we have created.
